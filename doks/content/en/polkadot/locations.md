The score in the table below is the theoretical value based on the 1kv source code on [Github](https://github.com/w3f/1k-validators-be). 

A popular location with many validators leads to a low score. To improve your location score, consider moving to a less popular location. 

Some providers are blacklisted by 1kv, which will result in a zero score for locations served by those providers. Locations to which that rule *may* apply, are indicated below in the "**Maybe blacklist**" column.
