The score in the table below is the theoretical value based on the 1kv source code on [Github](https://github.com/w3f/1k-validators-be). 

A popular provider with many validators leads to a low score. To improve your provider score, consider hosting with a less popular provider.

Some providers are blacklisted by 1kv, which will result in a zero score. They are also indicated in the "**Blacklist**" column.
